# ATLAS-website

Front-end and Back-end development of ATLAS website.

ATLAS is a centralized online service, which links internship providers with all academic institutions in the territory, creating a single database of internships available for selection by the institutions.

This project centers around the redevelopment of the existing website to a new, more user-friendly one simplifying the fundamental application stage of an internship.
